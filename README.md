Portfolio_Project

Hello! I'm Prit Panchani, a Computer Science student at San Francisco State University with a strong passion for coding, web development, and problem-solving. This portfolio is a showcase of the projects and skills I've developed throughout my journey. Here, you'll find examples of my work, including a personal weather app and more, designed to demonstrate my abilities in Python, JavaScript, and web development. I'm always eager to take on new challenges and continually improve my skills in the ever-evolving tech landscape.
